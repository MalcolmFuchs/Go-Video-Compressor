Hey! 
& Welcome to my own video compressor

To use this compressor, you must put the files (of format .mp4, .avi or .mov) in the "/files/input" directory.
After this, run the cmd "go run main.go", your files will be available in the "/files/output" directory.

PS: Safety wise :) the files in "/files/input" wont get deleted after.

Thanks my G for using my file compressor!

regards, 

Malcolm :)
